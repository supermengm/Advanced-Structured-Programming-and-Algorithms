# Recursion & Divide and Conquer
## Please use Substitution method to find Big-O of this recursion
`T(n) = 0               if n = 1`<br/>
`T(n) = T(n-1) + n - 1  if n â‰¥ 2`

## Please use Mater Theroem to analyze the following recursion:
`T(n) = 7* T * (n/2) + 500 * n^2`

## Please draw a diagram to show the search of 76 from the following numbers using Binary Serch
`6 12 28 29 45 54 62 76`

## Please draw a diagram to show the Merge Sort of these numbers
`34 13 20 15 43 44 19 23`
