# Measuring Fibonacci Series execution time in Java
## Please implement a Java program to print the first 100 numbers of Fibonacci Series
Use Java to measure its execution time in nanoseconds.

## References
Fibonacci numbers are strongly related to the golden ratio: Binet's formula expresses the nth Fibonacci number in terms of n and the golden ratio, and implies that the ratio of two consecutive Fibonacci numbers tends to the golden ratio as n increases.
